**EXPERIMENTAL** vNext Typescript Bounded Context Mono Repository Template

This repository has two main purposes
- As a template for bounded context mono repos
- As example code for the implementation of applications. It shows how to use common cross-cutting concerns' clients, like logging, auditing, platform-config and security.

# How to use this template

- Start by creating a new repository in GitHub using this template

![create repo from template](./readme-imgs/create_repo_with_template.png "Create repository using this template")

- Make sure package directory names conform to the standard and end with "lib", "svc" or "tool"()

Unsorted hints:
- For packages that don't require publishing to NPM, make sure you have the `"private": true` line in package.json. By contrast, for all modules that require NPM publishing make sure it is set to false.
-

## How to add dependencies with npm packages

```shell
npm -w packages/package-dir-name install npm_dependency_name
```
For development dependencies add the `--dev` at the end, like so:
```shell
npm -w packages/package-dir-name install npm_dependency_name --save-dev
```

**Notes:**
- Replace `package-dir-name` with the correct module name, it corresponds to the directory name
- Replace `npm_dependency_name` with the correct dependency name
- Common devDependencies, such as linters or test frameworks, should be installed/dependend in the main `package.json` to avoid repeating them in each of the monorepo's modules

## Packages

### Example Service - example-svc

This service exemplifies how to create a bounded context service that can be deployed.
The objective is to show how to use the most important vNext platform foundational services.

To make sure the service is docker image is build and published to DockerHub by the CI/CD pipeline, change the value of the "
publish_to_dockerhub" to true.

```json
"private": true,
"mojaloop": {
  "publish_to_dockerhub": true
},
```

Please see the details of the example service within its [README](./modules/example-svc/README.md) file.



## Usage

### Install NVM - Node version manager

More information on how to install NVM: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm

#### Use NVM to install the correct Node.js version

```bash
# (In the repository root directory - one having the .nvmrc file)
nvm install
nvm use
```

### Install Dependencies

All commands below assume you're positioned at the root of the monorepo.

```bash
npm install
```

### Build

```bash
npm run build
```

### Run

```bash
npm run start
```

### Unit Tests

```bash
npm run test:unit
```

### Integration Tests

```bash
npm run test:integration
```

### Execute locally the pre-commit checks - these will be executed with every commit and in the default CI/CD pipeline
Make sure these pass before committing any code

```bash
npm run pre_commit_check
```
